# GKU DKD MO DZM test_task
This is test task from **medical organization**. All tasks you can find in *'Test_task.docx'*. Now, open Excel-file *'test.xlsx'*. You will see the table in Excel and make some tasks. After that, please, open *'DKD_test_task_analys.ipynb'* file, where you can find the second part of test task. There are some typical questions on Python and work with data frames (I used pandas to read and write and change data)
