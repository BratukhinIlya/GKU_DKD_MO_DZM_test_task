# GKU DKD MO DZM test_task
This is test task from **medical organization**. All tasks you can find in *'test_task.docx'*. Now, open Excel-file *'test.xlsx'*. You will see the table in Excel and make some tasks. After that, please, open *'DKD_test_task_analys.ipynb'* file, where you can find the second part of test task. There are some typical questions on Python and work with data frames (I always use **pandas** to read and write and change data)
